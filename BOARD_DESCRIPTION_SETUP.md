# Board Description Feature Setup

## Database Migration Required

To enable the board description feature, you need to run the following SQL migration in your Supabase database:

### Step 1: Run Migration
Execute this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add description field to boards table
ALTER TABLE boards ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup
After running the migration:

1. Go to any board page
2. Click the **Info icon** (ℹ️) in the header
3. You should see a modal where you can add/edit descriptions
4. Descriptions will be saved to the database and persist between sessions

### Features
- ✅ Real-time database saving and retrieval
- ✅ Beautiful modal interface with editing capabilities
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Empty state handling for boards without descriptions

### File: `migration_add_description_to_boards.sql`
This migration file already exists in your project root and contains the necessary SQL command.

---

**Note**: The migration is already created in your project. Just run the SQL command in Supabase!
