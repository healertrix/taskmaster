# Recent Boards Implementation

## Overview

The "Recent Boards" feature shows the **last 6 accessed boards** for each user, rather than the last updated boards. This provides a more personalized experience based on user interaction.

## Current Implementation

### Database Schema

Recent boards are stored directly in the user's profile using a new column:

```sql
-- Add recent_boards column to profiles table
-- This will store an array of the 6 most recently accessed board IDs for each user
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN recent_boards UUID[] DEFAULT '{}';

-- Add comment to document the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN profiles.recent_boards IS 'Array of the 6 most recently accessed board IDs for this user, ordered by most recent first';
```

### How It Works

1. **Data Source**: Recent boards are stored in the `profiles.recent_boards` column as an array of board IDs
2. **Ordering**: Array is maintained with most recent board first
3. **Limit**: Shows only the last 6 accessed boards
4. **Updates**: When a user accesses a board, the array is updated to move that board to the front
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Only the 6 most recent boards are kept in the array

### Key Features

- ✅ **Limited to 6 Boards**: Shows only last 6 accessed boards
- ✅ **User-Specific**: Each user sees their own recently accessed boards
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Access tracking happens when users visit board pages
- ✅ **Efficient Storage**: Uses a simple array in the profiles table (no separate table needed)
- ✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Shows empty state for new users

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL script to add the recent_boards column:

```bash
# Apply the database migration
psql -d your_database < add_recent_boards_column.sql
```

### 2. Add Access Tracking to Board Pages

To track board access, add this to your board page components:

```typescript
// In app/board/[id]/page.tsx or similar board pages
import { trackBoardAccess } from '@/utils/boardAccess';
import { useParams } from 'next/navigation';

export default function BoardPage() {
  const params = useParams();
  const boardId = params.id as string;

  useEffect(() => {
    // Track that user accessed this board
    if (boardId) {
      trackBoardAccess(boardId);
    }
  }, [boardId]);

  // ... rest of component
}
```

### 3. Current Status

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Recent boards limited to 6 boards
- ✅ Updated loading skeletons (6 cards)
- ✅ Updated label to "(Last 6 accessed)"
- ✅ Empty state shown for new users
- ✅ Star functionality works on all recent boards

**What Needs Setup:**
- ⚠️ Database column addition (run the SQL script)
- ⚠️ Add `trackBoardAccess()` calls to board pages
- ⚠️ Initial data population (users need to visit boards to populate recent boards)

## How Recent Boards Array Works

When a user accesses a board:
1. The current `recent_boards` array is fetched from their profile
2. If the board ID already exists in the array, it's removed
3. The board ID is added to the front of the array
4. The array is trimmed to keep only the first 6 elements
5. The updated array is saved back to the user's profile

Example:
- User has `recent_boards: ['board-b', 'board-a']`
- User accesses `board-c`
- Array becomes `['board-c', 'board-b', 'board-a']`
- User accesses `board-a` again
- Array becomes `['board-a', 'board-c', 'board-b']`
- After accessing 6 different boards, only the most recent 6 are kept

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Access Timestamps**: Store timestamp with each board ID for more detailed tracking
2. **Access Frequency**: Track how often users visit boards
3. **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest boards based on access patterns
4. **Team Activity**: Show recently accessed boards by team members

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. **Before Setup**: Will show empty state for new users
2. **After Setup**: Visit some board pages, then check the Recent Boards section
3. **Empty State**: Shows empty state when user has no recent boards data

## Files Modified
