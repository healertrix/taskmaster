Performance Analysis & Optimization Strategy
1. Data Fetching Issues
Multiple Sequential API Calls: Many components make multiple API calls sequentially instead of in parallel
No Data Caching: Every navigation triggers fresh API calls
Waterfall Loading: Parent components wait for data before child components can start loading
2. State Management Problems
Prop Drilling: Deep component trees passing data through multiple levels
Redundant Re-renders: Components re-rendering unnecessarily due to poor state organization
No Global State: Each component manages its own data, leading to duplicate API calls
3. Bundle Size & Code Splitting
No Dynamic Imports: All components are loaded upfront
Large Initial Bundle: Everything loads on first page load
No Route-based Code Splitting: All routes bundled together
4. Rendering Performance
Missing Memoization: Components not using React.memo, useMemo, or useCallback effectively
Heavy Components: Large components doing too much work
No Virtualization: Long lists rendering all items at once
5. Network Optimization
No Request Deduplication: Same data fetched multiple times
Missing Optimistic Updates: Some operations wait for server response
No Background Refetching: Data becomes stale without user knowing
My Optimization Approach
Phase 1: Quick Wins (Immediate Impact)
Implement React Query/SWR for Data Fetching
Automatic caching and deduplication
Background refetching
Optimistic updates
Request batching
Add Loading States & Skeletons
Perceived performance improvement
Progressive data loading
Better user feedback
Optimize Bundle Size
Dynamic imports for modals and heavy components
Route-based code splitting
Tree shaking unused code
Phase 2: Core Optimizations
Implement Global State Management
Use Zustand or Redux Toolkit for shared state
Prevent duplicate API calls
Centralized data management
Database Query Optimization
Add proper indexes
Optimize N+1 queries
Implement pagination
Use database views for complex queries
Component Optimization
Implement React.memo for pure components
Use useMemo for expensive computations
useCallback for stable function references
Split large components
Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations
Implement Virtual Scrolling
For board lists and cards
For search results
For member lists
Add Service Worker
Offline support
Background sync
Push notifications
Image Optimization
Lazy loading
WebP format
Responsive images
CDN integration
Phase 4: Infrastructure
Edge Functions
Move API routes closer to users
Reduce latency
Database Connection Pooling
Reuse connections
Reduce connection overhead
CDN & Caching
Static asset caching
API response caching
Edge caching
Specific Code Areas to Optimize
Home Page (app/page.tsx)
Parallel data fetching
Lazy load workspace boards
Virtual scrolling for large workspace lists
Board Page (app/board/[id]/page.tsx)
Stream board data as it loads
Lazy load cards
Optimize drag-and-drop performance
Search Functionality
Implement search result caching
Add search suggestions
Paginate results
API Routes
Batch similar requests
Implement GraphQL or tRPC for efficient data fetching
Add response compression
Hooks Optimization
Combine related hooks
Share data between hooks
Implement suspense boundaries
Monitoring & Metrics
Add Performance Monitoring
Web Vitals tracking
API response times
Component render times
User Analytics
Track user interactions
Identify slow paths
Monitor error rates
Would you like me to start implementing these optimizations? I recommend starting with Phase 1 (Quick Wins) as they'll provide immediate performance improvements with minimal code changes.
